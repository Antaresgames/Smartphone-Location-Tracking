With the ever increasing array of location aware smartphone applications the need for accurate positioning has never been higher. Traditional methods provided by global positioning systems (GPS) has major drawbacks in its power consumption and its ability to work inside large buildings. Alternative methods of location tracking, such as using accelerometer and gyroscope data, provide a low power solution at the cost of much higher error rates. Localization has also been explored as an alternative to GPS for locating devices inside buildings by determining distance between WiFi or other RF transmitting devices. In our project we propose a method of tracking a smartphone by using the internal accelerometer, gyroscope, and compass. To help correct the error that seems to be inherent in these types of systems we will use a process of learning the location of WiFi devices through a learning period and then using those as anchor points to correct our estimated position.

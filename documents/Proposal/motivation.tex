Our motivation for trying this new method of location tracking is three fold. 
First, we want an improved method of tracking devices indoors.
Second, we want to reduce the power consumed by location tracking systems.
It is estimated that the GPS in smartphones uses 70 times more power than the accelerometer in the phone.
Third, we want to create a localization system that can quickly learn new locations without large amounts of training
